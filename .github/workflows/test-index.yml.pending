# We have two identicals jobs, but one of them has the DEBUG environment variable set to 1.
# There reason is to have a way to print the debug log in case of failure.
# But also to have a way to run the tests without the debug flag set, which is the default behavior.

# Avoid paralelism, because the tests are using the same resources in AWS S3
